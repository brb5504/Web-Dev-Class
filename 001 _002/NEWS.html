	<p>Sinclair Media Group has been reportedly courting the ousted <br>  Fox host Bill
	O’Reilly as well as Sean Hannity, which they deny, <br> and mulling over
	the possibility of collaborating with Steve Bannon,<br> the former Trump White
	House chief strategist who leads Breitbart News. <br>
	<br>
	If Sebastian Gorka’s-- A known White Nationalist-- interview with <br>
	a Sinclair-owned television station, is a harbinger of things to come,<br>
	his comment, “Black Africans are Murdering Each Other by the Bushel,” <br>
	is but the beginning.</p>

	<p>Tell the FCC that it’s direction under Ajit Pai, A Republican that joined the FCC<br>
	in 2012, was promoted to chairman by Donald Trump. Craig Aaron, President<br>
	of public interest group Free Press, believes that Pai is going out of his way to<br>
	relax the rules for the Sinclair Group.<br>
	FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, at a hearing last Wednesday, announced plans to<br>
	remove long-standing media ownership rules, that include how many<br>
	newspapers or stations a company can own in a single market.<br>
	<br>
	We’ve seen how the Donald Trump himself has launched attacks against<br>
	prominent Blacks and people of color, but with a far wider reach thanks to the<br>
	Sinclair Groups future media acquisitions. Trump gets to wield the most<br>
	powerful weapon of all, “Shaping public opinion, using local, over-the- air<br>
	television,” according to Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a senior attorney at<br>
	Georgetown’s Communications and Technology Law Clinic.<br>
	Sinclair Group currently owns 193 stations and reaches about 2 out of every 5 American homes.

	the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that’s POWER -- Malcolm X<br></p>
